title: Reverse Engineering a Unity Game

excerpt: How I found the boss claw patrol logic in Boneworks and built a mod to change it.
---

I've always wondered how people mod games -- figuring out all the APIs, what they do and hooking into them to make something cool. I recently went through this process of understanding the exact logic used in a part of the game and building a mod to change it. During this I learnt how C# and Unity compile to machine code, how to read disassembled x86 code and the various tools to help with these tasks. But before I get to that, I'll explain what I'm modding and why.

## 🎙️ Introduction

[Boneworks](https://store.steampowered.com/app/823500/BONEWORKS/) is amazing! 😍 If you're wondering why it's so great [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7irWC2uXuSY) sums it up nicely. I bought it when I first got my VR headset a year ago but my first playthrough was a nauseating experience as I managed to get my body stuck in the monkey bars of the museum. 🤢 I never even saw an enemy before putting it down and getting into other games like Beat Saber. But about a month ago I picked it back up and to my surprise I no longer got motion sick! I played through the whole story and the side chambers and loved it so much that I decided to keep playing it and turn to one of my favourite pastimes: speedrunning. 🏃 I mostly enjoy watching speedruns and letting other people put in the hundreds of hours of grinding and glitch hunting, so two weeks in and [with a respectable time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWU1n0-W-wA) that would have placed in the top 20 on the leaderboard if I'd submitted it, this was probably the furthest I'd ever gone into running a game myself. At this point, to get better times I needed to practise tricks like [flinging from the boss claw to the finish of Streets](https://youtu.be/1nZAoV9Tna8?t=167) so I could pull them off consistently. The problem with this is that the direction the boss claw travels is totally random, so it is annoying to practise when it rarely goes the right way for a fling. 😩 That's when I set out to fix this. I decided to build a mod to force it in the right direction and also see if I could reverse engineer the logic used to decide where the boss claw will go, just in case there's a way to influence it to go in the desired direction without mods.

## ⚙️ Technical background

This section will be pretty dense so I'll include a **tl;dr** in a quote block under each heading.

### 🏗️ How the game is compiled

> C# source code -> compiled to C# IL -> compiled to C++ code by IL2CPP -> compiled to x86 binary.

Boneworks is a [Unity](https://unity.com/) game, and as such the code is written in [C#](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)>). A lot of languages (eg. [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)) compile into instructions for a particular CPU architecture (eg. [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86) which is most popular for PCs today), but C# compiles to an intermediate language (IL) which no CPU understands. Instead an execution engine (eg. [Mono](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_(software)>)) interprets, compiles and runs the IL when the program is run. However this [just-in-time compiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) of the code adds overhead and for games, faster is better. This is why Unity built a tool called [IL2CPP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/IL2CPP.html).

IL2CPP transforms the IL into C++ code (as the name suggests). This C++ code can then be compiled to a particular CPU architecture, eliminating the overhead of an execution engine. One thing that is important to note though: usually in C++ the names of your variables and structures don't matter because they are all compiled down to memory addresses, but C# supports (and heavily uses) [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_programming) which allows code to introspect things like method names and types. IL2CPP outputs a file with all these symbols that the C++ code can use so that reflection features work. The compiled output (whether IL or IL2CPP binary) is a `.dll` file that is known in C# terminology as an _assembly_ (which is confusing because it is referring to a file containing machine code, while in computer science terminology the word assembly generally refers to a human-readable text format representing some machine code, and I'll be using this other definition further below when we get into disassembly).

So now that we have some background on how the game is compiled and which data is available, we can get to the actual process of reverse engineering!

### 🪛 C# decompilers

> dnSpy and ILSpy allow reading compiled C# code but won't work for Boneworks because of IL2CPP.

[dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy) is a popular tool which can do things like showing, debugging and editing C# code for a game. But this only works for IL (because IL instructions are similar to actual C# code) and doesn't work for IL2CPP assemblies. The tool has also been archived by the owner, so is no longer under development.

[ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) is another tool which does the same thing as dnSpy but seems less friendly. It is older and still actively developed though.

It would be great if I could open Boneworks with these tools since it would be really easy to read the C# code and see what the boss claw logic is, but ultimately it's not possible because they only read IL, not x86 binaries produced by IL2CPP. 🚧

### 🪄 IL2CPP reversers

> Il2CppInspector outputs the classes/methods/properties, their types and locations in the assembly. Cpp2IL converts the assembly to IL (which can be used with dnSpy/ILSpy).

[Il2CppInspector](https://github.com/djkaty/Il2CppInspector) is a tool that reads the reflection metadata from a compiled IL2CPP project. This gives us a list of all the classes, methods and properties with types as well as the address where they are in the assembly. The author has a [great blog series](https://katyscode.wordpress.com/tag/il2cpp/) that goes into how it works and the various obfuscation techniques game developers use to hide the reflection metadata from reverse engineering. It worked out of the box for Boneworks though (and the developers -- Stress Level Zero -- are modding-friendly by the way) so I had no issue with this. There are plenty of output options, like creating a C# project with class/method stubs, C headers and Python scripts to assign class/method names to locations in disassemblers.

[Cpp2IL](https://github.com/SamboyCoding/Cpp2IL) is a really interesting project that aims to reconstruct the IL from the compiled C++. C# decompilers like dnSpy/ILSpy can then be used to read the code in a much more friendly syntax than x86 assembly. I imagine IL2CPP produces a particular set of C++ code for some C# code, so that seems reversible but C++ to machine code can be very different, which is why it is so impressive that this project works at all. Unfortunately it's not perfect yet and there are many instances where it cannot reconstruct something and bails out of reconstructing the entire function.

### 🤖 x86 disassemblers

> Disassemblers turn binary into assembly. IDA is probably the best x86 disassembler (but automatic subroutine renaming based on reflection metadata doesn't work on free version).

Disassemblers turn machine code (eg. compiled C++, the raw 1s and 0s CPUs understand) into assembly (human-readable list of CPU instructions, not to be confused with C# assemblies which I mentioned above). There are many x86 disassemblers but two of the most popular are [IDA](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/) and [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/). IDA is better but many useful features are only in the paid version, while Ghidra is free and open-source. Il2CppInspector supports creating scripts for automatically renaming the subroutines identified by IDA and Ghidra to their real names based on the IL reflection metadata but unfortunately IDA free cannot run scripts and there were heaps of errors in the Ghidra file. 😕 In the end I just manually renamed subroutines every time I saw a `call` instruction as I was reading the disassembled code by cross-referencing the called address with the table produced by Il2CppInspector. 😒

Assembly code is pretty easy to read but hard to understand since it is so low-level. An example of assembly instructions is this:

```x86asm
add rax, 100   ; adds 100 to the rax register
add rax, rbx   ; adds the value in rbx to rax
add rax, [100] ; adds the value in memory at address 100 to rax
add rax, [rbx] ; adds the value in memory at address pointed to by rbx to rax
```

Basically the CPU has several registers which store a small amount of data (eg. a 64-bit integer) and reads/executes instructions from memory which operate on these registers. As you read through the assembly code, you can look up what instructions do and what registers are generally used for on Google and in CPU reference manuals to gradually learn everything.

I have some prior experience with x86 assembly so have no issues reading it but I'm not sure about conventions like where C++ usually stores arguments before calling another subroutine. Also there's just so much state you need to keep in your head to understand what's going on. 😵‍💫

### ⏯️ Inspecting a running game

> The incredible UnityExplorer mod lets you view and edit classes/methods/properties while the game is running.

There is an amazing mod called [UnityExplorer](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer) which reads the reflection metadata of the running game and allows you to view classes, edit properties, call methods and even has a C# REPL where you can run any script you want. All in real time while the game is running! 🤯 This mod was extremely helpful to quickly figure out how the boss claw works.

## 🗜️ Reverse engineering the boss claw

Alright, we're finally ready to start figuring out the internals of the boss claw! First thing is to load up the game, go to Streets and play around with UnityExplorer while watching the boss claw: watch how properties change as it moves, hook into methods to see when they're called, manually change properties and call methods to see what they do. Through this I found that its behaviour is controlled by the `BossClawAi` class (luckily to my surprise it was called the same thing in code as what the speedrunning community calls it) and I didn't spend time to learn _everything_ but here's what I was able to infer about its properties and methods:

```c#
public class BossClawAi : MonoBehaviour
{
    // === Important things for boss claw RNG! ===

    // The position it starts at (in the middle of the street)
    public Vector3 _homePosition { get; set; }
    // A plane that extends this many units from _homePosition in X and Z
    // directions. When patrolling it will choose a random point on this plane
    // to patrol to. The Z component is 0 (I assume an early version of the claw
    // behaved more like an arcade machine claw which can move in two dimensions
    // but the mechanics of the overhead arms would be complicated for it to go
    // to the drop-off point so they made it held up by an overhead track
    // instead and just reduced the Z to 0 to stay on the track).
    public Vector2 patrolXz { get; set; }
    // Manages pathing, movement and current target position. The claw is very
    // simple so barely needs an AI but it does have to go around a corner to
    // reach the drop-off point so I guess it makes sense to have one.
    public UnityEngine.AI.NavMeshAgent _navAgent { get; set; }
    // Called on each frame to perform claw logic.
    public void AiTick();


    // === Others ===

    // How often AiTick() is called.
    public float _aiTickFreq { get; set; }
    // Last time AiTick() was called.
    public float _lastAiTickTime { get; set; }
    // How often to move to a random patrol point.
    public float patrolFrequency { get; set; }
    // Time when it last moved to a random patrol point.
    public float _patrolTimer { get; set; }
    // List of targets it wants to pick up.
    public List<TriggerRefProxy> targetList { get; set; }
    // Target it's currently going for.
    public TriggerRefProxy _activeTarget { get; set; }
    // Percentage it's currently extended to the ground.
    public float _curExtension { get; set; }
    // Speed it is extending to the ground.
    public float _extensionVelocity { get; set; }
    // Called when it has grabbed something.
    public bool CaughtPrey();
    // Called on each frame.
    public void Update();
    // Called on each frame.
    public void FixedUpdate();
    // Called on load.
    public void Awake();
    // Change state.
    public void SwitchMentalState(MentalState mState);
    // Change state.
    public void SwitchPounceState(PounceState pState);
    // Set whether to show the blue barrier when picking something up.
    public void ToggleScoop(bool toggleOn);
    // Starts calling AiTick() on each frame. Claw becomes active after jumping
    // the wall in a run. Before then it just sits at the home position. I
    // assume this is for performance since the player won't see the claw when
    // they're somewhere else.
    public void SetActive();
    // Stop calling AiTick().
    public void SetDeactive();

    // === State === (including config for default)
    public MentalState _defaultState { get; set; }
    public PounceState _pounceState { get; set; }
    public MentalState _mentalState { get; set; }

    // === Config for movement ===
    public float _baseAcceleration { get; set; }
    public float acceleration { get; set; }
    public float speed { get; set; }

    // === Config for when it is attempting to grab something ===
    public float pounceSpeedMult { get; set; }
    public float pounceAccelMult { get; set; }
    public float pounceSpringMult { get; set; }

    // === Config for springiness when it's picking something up ===
    public float scoopSpringXz { get; set; }
    public float scoopDamperXz { get; set; }
    public float retractionTime { get; set; }

    // === Physics ===

    public Rigidbody _baseRb { get; set; }
    public ConfigurableJoint _jointBase { get; set; }
    public ConfigurableJoint _jointSpineA { get; set; }
    public ConfigurableJoint _jointSpineB { get; set; }
    public ConfigurableJoint _jointSpineC { get; set; }

    public UnityEngine.AudioClip _scoopOff { get; set; }
    public void AttenuateMovementLoop(ref AudioPlayer player, Transform parentTransform, float volume, float pitch);

    // === Not totally sure about the rest of these ===
    // Maybe AiTick() debounces and this bypasses that on next call?
    public bool _forceAiTick { get; set; }
    // Decides which objects it should try to pick up?
    public LayerMask preyLayers { get; set; }
    // Map of targets to something?
    public Dictionary<TriggerRefProxy, int> _targetRefCount { get; set; }
    // Some kind of ID for the current target?
    public ulong _activeTargetId { get; set; }
    // How far it should extend downwards to pick up its target?
    public float _targetExtension { get; set; }
    // For timing when to pounce again after missing a pounce?
    public float _pounceTimer { get; set; }
    // What objects are inside the claw?
    public Il2CppReferenceArray<Collider> _boxCheckResults { get; set; }
    // The area inside the claw which counts as grabbed?
    public Transform _boxCheck { get; set; }
    // Where to drop off grabbed objects?
    public Transform unloadPoint { get; set; }
    // ?
    public Vector3 _scoopDisplace { get; set; }
    // ?
    public Il2CppReferenceArray<GameObject> _scoopObjects { get; set; }
    // ?
    public void CheckTarget();
    // Stops moving?
    public void ClearPath();
    // Move to somewhere?
    public void SetPath(Vector3 target);
    // How "diagonal" the claw is as it extends?
    public void SetScoopXzDrives(float spring, float damper);
    // ?
    public void TriggerStateChange(TriggerRefProxy trp, bool enter = true);

    // === Different possible states ===
    public enum MentalState
    {
        Rest = 0,
        Patrol = 1,
        Pounce = 2,
        Unload = 3
    }
    public enum PounceState
    {
        Charge = 0,
        Drop = 1,
        Scoop = 2,
        Check = 3
    }
}
```

Note that many of these types (eg. [`UnityEngine.AI.NavMeshAgent`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AI.NavMeshAgent.html) or [`Vector3`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.html)) can be looked up in the Unity documentation to understand how they work.

### 🧑‍💻 Building the mod

From this I had all the information I needed to build a mod which makes the boss claw patrol to the finish of the level 100% of the time. Using the `OnSceneWasInitialized` hook in the [MelonLoader mod framework](https://melonwiki.xyz/) I found the `BossClawAi` by using the standard Unity APIs (`FindObjectOfType()`) and simply changed the `_homePosition` to the point where I wanted the claw to go and set `patrolXz` to `(0, 0)` so it would always go to exactly that point.

Since there was the possibility of cheating runs with this mod (consciously or accidentally) I also had it paint the boss claw green so it's obvious the mod is active.

Also interesting to note here is that MelonLoader comes with a library called [Harmony](https://harmony.pardeike.net/) which allows "patching" methods. This replaces the code at the memory address of the method with a stub that calls your `Prefix` handler, the original method, then your `Postfix` handler. I didn't need to use it for my mod though, since I could do everything with standard Unity APIs and the built-in MelonLoader hooks.

### 🔍 Decompiling the code

> ⚠️ These days I have a better workflow. This post still has some useful information but if you to decompile a game for modding I recommend following the steps in my newer post here: [🧰 Modding Unity IL2CPP Games](https://jf.id.au/blog/modding-unity-il2cpp-games)

I still wanted to know if the point it goes to was truly random though. To do this I used Cpp2IL to decompile the IL2CPP assembly back into IL using this command:

```powershell
.\Cpp2IL-2022.0.5-Windows.exe --game-path "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\BONEWORKS\BONEWORKS" --experimental-enable-il-to-assembly-please
```

The success rate of decompilation was 47% and unfortunately when I opened the output in dnSpy I found that `AiTick()` failed to decompile. 🙁

Output:

```
[Info] [Program] Overall analysis success rate: 47% (8617) of 18267 methods.
```

What dnSpy shows:

```c#
// Token: 0x0600074B RID: 1867 RVA: 0x00002050 File Offset: 0x00000250
[Token(Token = "0x600055C")]
[Address(RVA = "0x4EB1A0", Offset = "0x4E99A0", VA = "0x1804EB1A0")]
private void AiTick()
{
    throw new AnalysisFailedException("CPP2IL failed to recover any usable IL for this method.");
}
```

### 🔬 Disassembling the code

My backup plan was to read the assembly directly, so I loaded the game's assembly (`GameAssembly.dll`) into IDA. In addition to just converting the machine code, IDA analyses and works out the boundaries of all the subroutines and displays the disassembled code in a nice graph format. I ran Il2CppInspector on the game to find the address of `BossClawAi.AiTick()` and opened the subroutine graph at that address, since the logic for deciding where to go is probably in here. I knew that there should be a call to `NavMeshAgent.SetDestination()` just after it figures out the point it wants to patrol to so I searched for calls to its address in this subroutine and found a few of them. For each of these calls I worked backwards through the code, renaming any `call` instructions as I came across them to change the opaque memory address into a function name by cross-referencing the address with Il2CppInspector's output. Eventually I found what I think is the call that sends the boss claw to patrol.

The segment of assembly from IDA that sends the boss claw to a random point (with comments added by me):

                jmp     loc_1804EBB03
```

This is the code that maps to what I think the assembly above is doing:

```cs
float x = (bossClawAi.patrolXz.x * Random.value) * 2 - bossClawAi.patrolXz.x;
float z = (bossClawAi.patrolXz.z * Random.value) * 2 - bossClawAi.patrolXz.z;
Vector3 randCoord = new Vector3(x, 0, z);
Vector3 finalPatrolPoint = randCoord + bossClawAi._homePosition;
bossClawAi._navAgent.SetDestination(finalPatrolPoint);
```

What I found was what I was expecting (a call to get a random value followed by `NavMeshAgent.SetDestination()`) but not what I was hoping for 😞 (some logic which could be manipulated to force it to go in a certain direction). Although it's important to note that I'm not 100% certain on this. Assembly is complicated. I haven't worked out the purpose of every single instruction and there are so many other code paths in the function. There may be some trick to trigger one of the other `NavMeshAgent.SetDestination()` calls to send it in the desired direction. 🤷

## 📃 Conclusion

Through this I've learnt a lot about reverse engineering. Sometimes you can get lucky and get C# code to read, other times it's a painful and manual process of reading assembly and cross-referencing against metadata memory addresses. But at this point I feel pretty confident to reverse engineer some aspect of a Unity game and what tools are available. Hope you've learnt a bit about this too from this post! 👍
